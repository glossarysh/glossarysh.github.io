A Database Administrator is a technical professional who specialises in the managing and optimization of database systems.

They are ususally employed by organisations that run large, complicated databases systems with critical requirements on reliability and performance.

They differ from [Database Developers](/database-developer) in that a Database Administrators role tends to be more focussed on maintaining operational systems that are being used in production.
