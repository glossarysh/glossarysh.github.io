C++ is a programming language that is often used for building performance critical applications. It has seen a lot of use in games, scientific computing and important infrastructure programs like [operating systems](operating-system) and [database software](database).

C++ has a reputation as being hard to use but offers programmers a great deal of control over how the computer will execute their code. It is an extension of the the [C programming language](c).
