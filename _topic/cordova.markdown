Cordova is a set of tools that make it possible to build [mobile applications](mobile-applications) using web technologies. Traditionally, if you wanted to build an app you would have to build multiple different copies of the same app using the programming language that is specific to the phone platform you are targeting, ie Android or iOS. Cordova allows you to build a single app that can run on any type of phone by utilising the same technologies and programming languages used to build websites for the [World-Wide-Web](world-wide-web).

It is occasionally critised for creating applications that do not run as fast as the equvilent app build using the programming language that is specific to the phone the app is running on.
