Source code is a text based representation of a [computer program](computer-program) that is easier for a human to understand. This allows humans to be able to create and understand computer programs without having to learn the complicated [binary-based instructions](machine-code) that a computer understands.

Source code needs to go through a transformative process before a computer can understand and execute the instructions. This additional step is called [compiling](compiler).

## Examples
- [Python](python). Python is a widely used source code language that is known for its simplicity and readability.
