C is a programming language that is often used for communicating with hardware. It is described as a 'low-level' programming language, which means that it more accurately represents what is executed by the computers processing unit, as oppose to other languages that tend to prioritise being easy for a human to understand. The result of this is that, whilst hard to use, C offers a programmer a great deal of control over how their code is executed on the computer. This has lead to its widespread use for building software that directly communicates with the hardware of a computer.
