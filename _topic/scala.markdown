Scala is a programming language designed to be compatible with Java whilst being a more modern alternative. It can run on the same computers as Java can and is capable of directly accessing using code from programs written in Java.

The language itself is intended to be more modern and concise than Java. One of the ways it manages this is by incorporating many ideas from programming languages that follow the [Functional style of programming](functional-programming).
