A Content Management System (CMS) is a software system that manages the creation and modification of digital content.

Although similar to databases, a CMS system tends to be a more fully-featured set of tools designed to be easy to use for users who aren't programmers, although all CMS systems will have a database at their core.

Examples of CMS products:
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/){:target="_blank"} is popular and [open source](/open-source-software),
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/){:target="_blank"} is a proprietary, fully-managed CMS product.
