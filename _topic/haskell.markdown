Haskell is a programming language often used in academia to study [functional programming](functional-programming). Its syntax is very different from most programming languages and it is not as widely used in industry as languages like [Java](java) and [Python](python). It is often described as a very "pure" language. This means that it very strictly follows its original design conventions which can often make it more difficult to learn for programmers not familiar with the ideas that inspired the language.
