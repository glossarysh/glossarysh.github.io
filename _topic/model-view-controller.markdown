Model-View-Controller is a common design convention for building web applications. It semantically seperates out the core components of the application into three, seperate parts. The Model is responsible for representing the application data, the View is reponsible for displaying that data to the user and the Controller is responsible for orchestrating how the View and Model communicate as well as how the user can change the application data.
