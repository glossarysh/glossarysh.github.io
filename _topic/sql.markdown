Structured Query Language, or SQL, is a [programming language](programming-language) for retrieving or manipulating data stored in a database. It is most often used in conjunction with an SQL Database, a type of database specifically designed to be used with the SQL language. In an SQL Database, data is stored as rows and columns in tables, similar to spreadsheets. However, SQL gives you a lot more control over what can and cannot be stored in each table, as well as allowing you to create links between tables to represent how the subjects of that data are related in the real world.

One of the advantages of using an SQL database to store your data is that it allows you to create a lot of rules and restrictions on how your data is stored which helps you to ensure the integrity of your data. The down side of all of these extra rules is that SQL Databases aren't very well suited to storing very large amounts of data, particularlly when the data is so large it cannot fit in a single computer.
