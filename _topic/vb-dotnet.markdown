VB.NET is a programming language created by Microsoft for the [.NET platform](dotnet-framework). It differs from [C#](csharp) in that it often uses words instead of symbols to represent operations, but is otherwise very similar and is compatible with the same [libraries](library) that C# is. VB.NET is not as widely used as C#.
