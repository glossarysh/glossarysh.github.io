React Native is a set of tools for building user interfaces in mobile applications. It is based on the same methodologies and ideas as the [React.JS](reactjs) library for building user interfaces for web applications. It allows the programmer to use the same languages used to build [Web Applications](web-applications) whilst still being as performant as mobile applications written using the official languages used for a specific platform.
