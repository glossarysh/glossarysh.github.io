SQLite is a [SQL](sql) database product that is designed to be simpler and use fewer resources than other database products. It is often "embedded" into other, larger programs to serve as storage for data that the program needs to reuse inbetween being turned on and off. It doesn't not have all of the features of other database products and is not designed to be able to support the load of a large, multi-user [web application](web-application).
