The .NET Framework is a [software framework](framework) that first released by [Microsoft](microsoft) in 2002. It was originally designed to build [desktop applications](desktop-application) but has since expanded to be used to build [server-side](client-server) [web](web-application) and [mobile](mobile-application) applications.

Although the .NET Framework can only run on Windows, a community project called Mono was later created to allow programs written for the .NET Framework to run on other operating systems besides Windows.

Microsft have since started a new related project called [.NET Core](dotnet-core).
