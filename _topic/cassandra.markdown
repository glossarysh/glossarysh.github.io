Cassandra is a database product used for storing very large amounts of data. It stores the data in a similar way to an Excel spreadsheet, as a series of rows and columns. For this reason, it is often referred to as a type of "Column Store". It differs from [SQL Databases](sql) in that it doesn't allow the programmer to perform some of the more complicated types of queries that you can with SQL. This trade-off allows it to perform better when handling very large amounts of data.
